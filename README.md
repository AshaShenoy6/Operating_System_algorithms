# Operating_System_algorithms
C programs for algorithms used in memory management and process management

1) FCFS-First Come First Serve, SJF- Shortest Job First and Round Robbin scheduling algorithms will determine the average waiting time and average turnaround time for processes in a queue.
2) FIFO-First in first Out, LRU-Least Recently Used and Optimal page replacement algorithms will determine the number of page faults for pages or frames in memory.
3) Producer_consumer problem is implemented using semaphores.
4) Bankers algorithm is used for deadlock avoidance.
